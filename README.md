## How to use this:
This repository contains Geospatial data analysis files. First you need to download the data which is not present in this repository. In order to download the data you need to use the retrieve_data.py 

The notebook Geo_data_analysis.ipynb contains all the analysis and code required for the assignment. You can also open the html version of the notebook saved as Geo_data_analysis.html.

I've completed all the tasks provided in the document.
